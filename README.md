# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Online-Retail-Data.
This repository contains the code and analysis for an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of online retail data. The project aims to explore and gain insights into customer behavior, sales patterns, and product trends through comprehensive data analysis techniques.

# Features:
1. Data Cleaning: The dataset is cleaned to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring data quality for analysis.
2. Descriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics are calculated to summarize the main characteristics of the dataset, including mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and percentiles.
3. Visualization: Data visualization techniques are employed using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visual representations of the data, including histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and time 
   series plots.
4. Customer Segmentation: Techniques such as RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis or clustering algorithms are used to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.
5. Sales Analysis: Analysis of sales trends, revenue distribution, and seasonal patterns to understand sales performance and identify growth opportunities.
6. Product Analysis: Examination of product categories, popularity, and customer preferences to optimize inventory management and marketing strategies.
